Dear Customer Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the product I recently purchased from your online store. The order number is #123456.

Unfortunately, the item arrived damaged and does not function as advertised. Specifically, the device fails to power on despite multiple attempts to charge it using the provided cable.

I would appreciate it if you could guide me through the process for a replacement or a refund at your earliest convenience. I have attached photos of the product showing the damage.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
John Doe
